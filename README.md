# Orbit Top 500 US Official Docs

## Introduction

#### Why Official Filings Matter in Investment Research and Risk & Compliance

Investment research and risk management rely heavily on official filings as they provide the most accurate,
comprehensive, and up-to-date information about a company's financial health, operational performance, and risk
exposures. Documents such as annual reports, earnings releases, and regulatory filings are primary sources of truth,
offering insights critical for:

- Investment Research: Identifying growth drivers, assessing financial performance, and analyzing risk factors.
- Risk & Compliance: Monitoring regulatory disclosures, understanding governance structures, and ensuring compliance
  with evolving standards.
- Systematic Analysis: Developing data-driven models by extracting structured information across multiple companies and
  industries.

However, analyzing these documents at scale is challenging due to their unstructured nature. This dataset is designed to
empower users to build their own RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) solutions, enabling efficient information
extraction and systematic analysis.

#### About the Dataset

This repository provides one year of filings for the top 500 US companies and is updated monthly. The dataset includes
three formats to support diverse use cases:

- Original PDF Files:
    - Direct from official sources, retaining all formatting and annotations.
- Machine-Readable Text Versions:
    - Simplified, raw text extracted from PDFs for NLP and text analysis workflows.
- Vector Versions:
    - Pre-processed for retrieval systems, enabling semantic search and advanced AI applications.

#### Dataset Size

The dataset is organized into approximately 5,713 files, occupying a total S3 storage size of ~314.57 GB. Below is the
breakdown by format:

- PDF Files: ~5.85 GB
